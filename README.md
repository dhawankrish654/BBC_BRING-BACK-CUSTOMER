Let's face it: Retail has come a long way.
 

In just the last decade, we've gone from clunky cash registers and being buried under a never-ending pile of paperwork to using a single gadget that allows retailers to sell anywhere.

With today's evolving retail technology, retailers can run their entire store with nothing more than a tablet or smartphone with just a touch, swipe, and tap of a few buttons.

Using a mobile device, a robust point-of-sale software and a few retailer apps, merchants can process transactions in their storefront or on-the-go at pop-ups or markets, fairs, and festivals.
 

Finding the right point-of-scale system is the first step in your quest to sell anywhere. And a few key retailer apps can help extend the functions of your point-of-sale to fill in gaps and make running your retail store as seamless as possible.

But which retailer apps will help merchants the most with day-to-day tasks? As a retail entrepreneur, you don't have much time for trial and error. Never fear — we've spent time researching, analysing, and building a curated retailer application for you.
